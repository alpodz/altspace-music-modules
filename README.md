This is a collection of Music Modules for the Social VR platform Altspace. These modules can be wired (as in a Max/MSP, PureData paradigm) while in VR for new combinations. Useful for purposes of education, performance, and 24-7 (left running) installations in the VR worlds. 

Current Modules Include:
 * Piano - that can be played via remote midi messages, in world clicks, or in world touches). This piano also has options for note display on the keys, as well as an interval analysis and display. 
 * Staff - Can show midi data. Can also function as a drawing surface. In world touches of the notes on the staff can generate further midi events that can be sonified.
 * Tablature - Similiar to Staff, but displays midi data from the "You Rock Guitar" midi guitar, if sending in one string per channel mode. 
 * Spawner - emits midi events a series of floating cubes. In world touches can trigger the sounding of the note.
 * Sequencer - step sequencer which output midi events to other modules
 * WavPlayer - plays back samples on receiving of midi events. Used in conjunction with other modules. ie, Piano->WavePlayer
